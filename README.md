# Credit_Risk_Analysis

### Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to see what model does the better job at predicting credit risk using different attributes of customers like interest rate, last payment date, installments, homeownership, rent / mortgage, etc. At the end of the analysis we were able to decide on what model was the best fit to predict something like a high credit risk. Since there are few high risk for every low risk entries, it is harder to call the high risk accounts with precision.
